## Welcome to the OWASP API Security Top 10 - 2019!

Welcome to the first edition of the OWASP API Security Top 10. If you're
familiar with the  OWASP Top 10 series, you'll notice the similarities: they are
intended for readability and adoption. Otherwise, consider visiting the [OWASP
API Security Project wiki page][1], before digging deeper into the most critical
API security risks.

APIs play a very important role in modern applications' architecture. Since
creating security awareness and innovation have different paces, it's important
to focus on common API security weaknesses.

The primary goal of the OWASP API Security Top 10 is to educate those involved
in API development and maintenance, for example, developers, designers,
architects, managers, or organizations.

In the [Methodology and Data][2] section, you can read more about how this first
edition was created. In future versions, we want to involve the security
industry, with a public call for data. For now, we encourage everyone to
contribute with questions, comments, and ideas at our [GitHub repository][3] or
[Mailing list][4].
