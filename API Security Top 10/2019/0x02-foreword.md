Foreword
========

A foundational element of innovation in todayâ€™s app-driven world is the
Application Programming Interface (API). From banks, retail, and transportation
to IoT, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities, APIs are a critical part of
modern mobile, SaaS, and web applications and can be found in customer-facing,
partner-facing, and internal applications.

By nature, APIs expose application logic and sensitive data such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and because of this, APIs have increasingly
become a target for attackers. Without secure APIs, rapid innovation would be
impossible.

Although a broader web application security risks Top 10 still makes sense, due
to their particular nature, an API-specific security risks list is required.
API security focuses on strategies and solutions to understand and mitigate the
unique vulnerabilities and security risks associated with APIs.

If you're familiar with the [OWASP Top 10 Project][1], then you'll notice the
similarities between both documents: they are intended for readability and
adoption. If you're new to the OWASP Top 10 series, you may be better off
reading the [API Security Risks][2] and [Methodology and Data][3] sections
before jumping into the Top 10 list.
