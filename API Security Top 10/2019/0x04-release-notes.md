Release Notes
=============

This is the first OWASP API Security Top 10 edition, which we plan to be updated
periodically, every three or four years.

Unlike this version, in future versions, we want to make a public call for data,
involving the security industry in this effort. In the [Methodology and Data][1]
section, you'll find more details about how this version was built. For more
details about the security risks, please refer to the [API Security Risks][2]
section.

It is important to realize that over the last few years, architecture of 
applications has significantly changed. Currently, APIs play a very important
role in this new architecture of microservices, Single Page Applications (SPAs),
mobile apps, IoT, etc.

The OWASP API Security Top 10 was a required effort to create awareness about
modern API security issues. It was only possible due to a great effort of
several volunteers, all of them listed in the [Acknowledgments][3] section.
Thank you!
